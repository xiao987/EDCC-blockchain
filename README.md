[Shard Coin][website-url] is designed to be a secure and decentralised open source proof of stake digital currency, focusing on performance, security and fast low-cost transactions. The Shard Community Reserve assists with market liquidity and reducing volatility. With the community we are looking to revolutionise the cryptocurrency experience allowing users easy access and usability, bringing it to the mainstream for day to day life.

Shard can be used not only as a cryptocurrency, but also as a utility coin in multiple Shardax projects. Such as the Shardax Digital Asset Exchange & Staking Platform, Universal Infinity Wallet and the Quantum Project. In addition to the extra benefits when using Shard on these platforms; Shardax uses 20% of profits for liquidity, buying and burning Shard. This will decrease the existing supply, while coin holders can continuously stake without excessive inflation.

## Development Process

Developers work in their own trees, then submit pull requests when
they think their feature or bug fix is ready.

The patch will be accepted if there is broad consensus that it is a
good thing. Developers should expect to rework and resubmit patches.

The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be
completely stable. [Tags](https://github.com/ShardcoinRepo/shard/tags) are created
regularly to indicate new official, stable release versions of Shard.

The contribution workflow is described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Developers can join the official [Shard Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/SFqSd3U)



## Contributing

We strongly recommend that the community help make improvements and determine the future direction of Shard and the Shard protocol. We expect every contributor to be respectful and constructive so that everyone has a positive experience

#### Read our [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Reporting an issue

We currently only use GitHub for tracking issues, feature request and pull requests. If you're not familiar with these tools have a look at the [GitHub](https://help.github.com/en) documentation.

To report bugs please create an issue [here][issues-url].

#### Bug report

If you think you have found a bug feel free to open a GitHub issue, but first:
- check with GitHub's search engine that the bug doesn't already exist.
- in the request give as much information as possible such as: the OS, the version , how to reproduce and etc.

#### Missing feature

We also use the GitHub issue tracker for features. If you think that some piece of functionality is missing in Shard, you can open an issue with the following in mind:
- check for similare feature requests already open.
- provide as much detail and context as possible.
- be as convincing as possible as to why we need this feature and how everybody can benefit from it.

*It will take around 90 years if the entire current supply was staking to reach the max supply. However currently only around 50%-60% of current supply is staking meaning it will most likely take around 135-180 years to reach the max supply.

## Testing

Testing and code review is the bottleneck/delay for any development. Please be patient and help out by testing
other people's pull requests to provide feedback, and remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people
lots of money.

### Automated Testing

We will be integrating Travis CI system to makes sure that every pull request is built for Windows, Linux, and OS X, and that unit/sanity tests are run automatically.

### Manual Quality Assurance (QA) Testing

Changes should be tested by somebody other than the developer who wrote the
code. This is especially important for large or high-risk changes. It is useful
to add a test plan to the pull request description if testing the changes is
not straightforward.



## Translations

Changes to translations as well as new translations can be submitted to
[Shard Coin Core Transifex page](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/shard-coin/).

Translations are periodically pulled from Transifex and merged into the git repository. See the
[translation process](doc/translation_process.md) for details on how this works.

**Important**: We do not accept translation changes as GitHub pull requests because the next
pull from Github would automatically overwrite them again.

Translators should also join our [Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/SFqSd3U).
